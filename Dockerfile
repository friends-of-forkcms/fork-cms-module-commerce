# Since npm 5.7.0, the new npm ci command is introduced that installs ONLY from the lock-file.
# Beyond guaranteeing you that you'll only get what is in your lock-file it's also much faster (2x-10x!) than

# catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the incrementally-installed local environments of most npm users.

# Frontend/Theming

Currently the module includes the `CommerceDemo` demo theme which is used in the preview url and to develop locally.
It's built using an modern and productive stack:

-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a highly customisable CSS framework which can be used directly in your HTML. No more heavy CSS!
-   [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), a lightweight tool for progressive enhancement. Sprinkle some javascript on our Twig templates.
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a lightning fast build tool âš¡. Only needs a `vite.config.js` file, less complex than Webpack.
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

The demo theme uses a few dependencies. We try to avoid jQuery and go for lightweight, vanilla JS libraries. E.g.

-   [Algolia Autocomplete.js](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete) which provides a simple way to create a very powerful search box.
-   [Splide](https://splidejs.com/), a lightweight slider and carousel written in pure Javascript without any dependencies.
-   [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf), a simple, minimalistic, dependency-free, ~ 3KB Javascript library for toast notifications.
-   [Photoswipe](https://photoswipe.com) a vanilla Javascript lightbox/image gallery without dependencies.

## Run Vite dev server with HMR

When we edit our .html.twig, .ts or .css files, we would like to instantly see the changes. Start the frontend dev server with:

```bash
cd src/Frontend/Themes/CommerceDemo
npm run dev
```

This will start up Vite in watch-mode, and also output Typescript errors in the console.
The `vite_entry_link_tags` and `vite_entry_script_tags` Twig tags in `Base.html.twig` will check if the dev server is running and output the appropriate tags.
